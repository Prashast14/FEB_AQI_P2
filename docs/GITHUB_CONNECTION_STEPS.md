# GitHub Connection Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub (IN PROGRESS)

A browser window should have opened to: https://github.com/new

If not logged in, please log in first, then go to: https://github.com/new

### Fill in the form:

1. **Repository name**: `FEB_AQI_P2`
   
2. **Description** (optional): 
   ```
   Air Quality Index Analysis Project - Power BI Dashboard and Data Analytics
   ```

3. **Visibility**: Choose either:
   - ☑️ **Public** - Anyone can see this repository
   - ☑️ **Private** - Only you can see this repository

4. **⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT - DO NOT CHECK THESE:**
   - ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
   - ❌ DO NOT add .gitignore
   - ❌ DO NOT choose a license
   
   *(We already have these files locally!)*

5. Click **"Create repository"** button

## 📋 Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a setup page.

Look for the section that says **"Quick setup"** and copy the HTTPS URL.

It will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FEB_AQI_P2.git
```

**Note down your GitHub username:** _____________________

## 🔗 Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Once you have created the repository and copied the URL, come back here and let me know!

I'll then run the commands to connect your local repository to GitHub.
